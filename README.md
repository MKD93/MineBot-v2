# MineBot-v2

## A Minesweeper solver written in C++. Supports solving and "cheating" on Windows XP Minesweeper games.

## Instructions:
#### Download source code and compile, or download executable files. Run one or more instances of Minesweeper from the provided executable file. Run the solve or cheat executables to solve or cheat on active instances of Minesweeper.

## Notes:
#### The solve and cheat executables will terminate if there are no active instances of Minesweeper. It is possible to solve or cheat on newly created instances of Minesweeper while the solve or cheat executables are already running. After the Minesweeper game has terminated, the user must manually reset the game in order to continue solving or cheating on that game.
